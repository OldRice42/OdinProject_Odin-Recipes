    Here is a simple but delicious crepe batter which can be made in minutes. It's made from ingredients that everyone
    has on hand.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      1 cup all-purpose flour
    </li>
    <li>
      2 eggs
    </li>
    <li>
      1/2 cup water
    </li>
    <li>
      1/4 tsp salt
    </li>
    <li>
      2 tbsp butter, melted
    </li>
  </ul>
  <ol>
    <li>
      In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour and the eggs. Gradually add in the milk and water,
      stirring to combine. Add the salt and butter; beat until smooth.
    </li>
    <li>
      Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the
      griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each crepe. Tilt the pan with a circular motion so that the batter coats
      the surface evenly.
    </li>
    <li>
      Cook the crepe for about 2 minutes, until the bottom is light brown. Loosen with a spatula, turn and cook
      the other side. Serve hot.
    </li>
  </ol>
